# basicHTML5

I have converted the SVG given images to PNG images, then they would be useful for the assignment.

I have created a main page called main-page.html which contains buttons to interact with the different categories there

There are 9 buttons that are called hover, a hover also includes a shadow that give the impression to be a button without being one

I mean, i have not used the tag "<button>" given by HTML to do a button functionality for this task.
